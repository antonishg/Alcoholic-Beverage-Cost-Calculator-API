# Alcoholic Beverage Price Calculator API
This is the back end for the _Alcoholic Beverage Price Calculator_ found in:
https://github.com/antonishg/Alcoholic-Beverage-Cost-Calculator

The calculation takes place at a back-end which is written using NodeJS
The front-end is written in React Native.

_There is no database used by the back end but you can use this structure and
store your database logic under models.
Also because of the small size of the application there is no need for middleware but the
directory is there._
